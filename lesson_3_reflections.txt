When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to do collaborative work with other contributors, for example at
    work or on special projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we might want to work on certain commit on our own without having to
    bother on other people's changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are basically a remote repository cloned from other remote repository.
    We want forks when we want to change a remote repository but we do not have
    permission doing so.
    Clones are basically a local repository cloned from remote or other local 
    repository. We want clones when we want to work on a repository on our local
    machine. These local repo can always be pushed to the remote clones.
    Branches are a local repository in our own computer. We want to work on branch
    especially when we want to add feature, bug fix, improve code, or even just
    experiment on things without breaking the master (production-quality) branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
